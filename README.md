<h1>Project Proposal - Gymify</h1>
<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
When working out, it can be difficult to maintain a consistent workout schedule that challenges
the body, often resorting to people using lighter weights or reducing the intensity of their
exercises. By using Gymify, everything a user does is tracked and the user will be able to
monitor their progress and also maintain accountability for their sessions, making sure that they
stay on track.
<h2>Project Objectives</h2>
People who want a steady work routine may have difficulty maintaining a steady workout
schedule and keeping track of their workout progression. Gymify aims to solve these issues by
allowing users to create a personalized workout routine, view previous workout logs, view
in-depth statistics, and access a variety of exercise catalogs. The app will also incentivise and
motivate users to push their limits further by using leaderboards, interactive games, and
integrated workout videos.

<h2>Stakeholders</h2>

- People new to fitness that are looking to learn and guide themselves through different
exercises.
- Experienced active users looking for tools to track workouts/progress and enhance their

their own fitness community.
- Personal trainers and coaches who would want to manage client workouts, monitor
